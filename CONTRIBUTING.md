# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This repo is a POC for a Trello-like app with native generative AI.

## Getting started

- Read `docs/PRD.md` to understand scope and architecture.
- Open issues or proposals before large changes.

## Workflow

- Fork/branch from `main`.
- Keep changes small and focused; include tests where applicable.
- Open a PR; CI will lint Markdown docs.

## Docs guidelines

- Use Markdown with fenced code block languages (e.g., ```json).
- Keep headings and lists surrounded by blank lines.
- PRs should not introduce markdownlint errors.
